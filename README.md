**TipMe** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Haley Kell**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Split the bill
- [X] Tab bar navigation for main page and settings page
- [X] Currency options on settings page that are remembered across app restarts
- [X] Light/Dark view options on settings page that are remembered across app restarts

## Notes

I'm new to iOS programming, so finding the right resources to help solve problems was challenging. I enjoyed getting to create an app that has the potential for extra features and being able to design and implement those on my own. Specifically, I spent more time figuring out how to incorporate the settings changes from the Settings view controller to the tip calculator view controller without restarting the app. I also had to figure out how to incorporate settings across restarts of the app. Another challenge was checking if the last restart was less than ten minutes ago.
